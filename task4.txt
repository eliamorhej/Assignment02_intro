Atom vs Terminal Commands

Both tools have their pros and cons. Atom is user-friendly,
 makes things easier when you’re working on the same machine and conveniently,
 is a direct text-editor built into it on top of being able to use git. It’s also customizable with themes.

On the other hand, getting used to using raw git commands from the terminal is the safest way
of using git because it will work on any git-using machine,
and is more favorable when you work on different machines just like us students.
This way does however lack Atom’s user-friendliness.
I think I prefer the raw git commands simply because I’m someone who sees learning the raw git commands as a useful thing,
plus downloading Atom and getting it set up every single class is quite bothersome.
 However, I have not dismissed Atom’s usefulness and I would consider using it or something similar in the future.
